## My process

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM Naming Convention
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

#### The :invalid CSS pseudo-class

This selector allows to customize styles to invalid elements see below:

```css
.signup__input-email:invalid ~ .signup__error-input {
  display: block;
}
```

### Useful resources
